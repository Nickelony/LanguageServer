/// defaults describe a conventional completion item list with optional icon and detail columns: a
/// 420-pixel content-width floor, a 52-pixel horizontal chrome, a 920-pixel maximum window width, a
/// 300-pixel maximum height (AvalonEdit's own cap), a 24-pixel icon column reserved for items that supply
/// an image, and a 12-pixel gap between text and detail whenever detail text is present.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The width options live in the two spaces of the sizing formula: <see cref="WindowMinContentWidth"/> is a
/// content-space floor applied before the chrome is added, while <see cref="WindowMaxWidth"/> and
/// <see cref="WindowMaxHeight"/> are window-space caps. The controller rejects an options record whose
/// maximum window width cannot hold the minimum content width plus the chrome, because such a record could
/// never honor its own floor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Different item templates require different values; a host that measures its items with a
/// different layout supplies <see cref="TextCompletionControllerHooks.MeasureItemWidth"/> instead of these numbers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Every numeric option validates itself when it is assigned, so an invalid value is rejected at the

	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The non-activating window is the library's default because an editor keeps the keyboard focus while the

	/// metadata is <see langword="false"/>); the default installs a WPF <see cref="System.Windows.Window.SourceInitialized"/>
	/// hook that answers the Win32 mouse-activate message with "no activate", which is what keeps a click in
	/// the list from activating the window. Because WPF suppresses its native click-to-select path in a
	/// non-activating window, the controller pairs the default with explicit click selection. A host that wants
	/// the completion list to activate and take focus normally - for example an embedded editor - sets this
	/// option to <see langword="false"/>; the controller then installs neither the window-activation hook nor

	/// The check runs when the window is shown (at <c>ContextIdle</c> priority after the initial selection) and

	/// The policy consults the selected item through <see cref="ICommitCharacterCompletionData"/>: when the
	/// typed character is one of the item's declared characters, the item is committed and the character is
	/// typed in the same input step. Items that declare no characters, and hosts whose item mapping does not
	/// implement the interface, are unaffected; a host that wants editors which never accept on a typed
	/// character sets this option to <see langword="false"/>.
