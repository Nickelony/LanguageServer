	/// <remarks>
	/// The path is normalized for document identity (including trailing directory separators) while the
	/// supplied path is retained as
	/// <see cref="WorkspaceDocumentSnapshot.DisplayPath"/>. Only fully qualified paths are accepted: a
	/// relative path is invalid input, because resolving it against the process current directory
	/// would bind document identity to ambient process state. Opening an already tracked path returns
	/// <see cref="WorkspaceDocumentOpenStatus.AlreadyOpen"/> without reading it again; when a delete of
	/// that document is in flight, the call waits for the delete to resolve and then re-evaluates the
	/// path: a failed delete reports <see cref="WorkspaceDocumentOpenStatus.AlreadyOpen"/>, and a
	/// completed delete makes the call a fresh open. An open also waits for an in-flight rename or
	/// save-as that reserves the path as its destination, and for an earlier open of the same path,
	/// then re-evaluates. A path that exists as a directory is rejected with
	/// <see cref="WorkspaceDocumentOpenStatus.IsDirectory"/>. A missing path
	/// uses <see cref="WorkspaceDocumentOpenOptions.NewFileFormat"/>.
