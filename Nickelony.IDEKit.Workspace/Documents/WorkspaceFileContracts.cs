/// For an existing file, the stamp includes its byte length, last-write time, and content hash. The
/// default implementation hashes the content with SHA-256 and formats it as uppercase hexadecimal;
/// the replacement-failure classification relies on that format. <see cref="Missing"/> represents a
/// file that does not exist. With the default
/// <see cref="LocalWorkspaceFileSystem"/>, capturing a stamp reads and hashes the whole file
/// (SHA-256). Every capture therefore costs time
/// proportional to the file size; capture a stamp once and pass it around instead of re-capturing it
/// per check.
/// The stamp comparison is deliberately conservative: a rewritten file usually receives a new
/// last-write time, so the stamp differs and the change is reported as an external conflict. When a
/// coarse timestamp (FAT/exFAT) or a network share keeps the previous time, the content hash still
/// detects the rewrite.
