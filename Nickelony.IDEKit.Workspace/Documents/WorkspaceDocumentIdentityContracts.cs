/// <see cref="DisplayPath"/> is the supplied path retained for display. The logical content is in
/// <see cref="Text"/>; the snapshot captures the content as an immutable string and builds line metadata
/// on first line-oriented access, so creating a snapshot does not build the line index.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="PersistedVersion"/> records the document version represented by the persisted
/// content; it can lag <see cref="Version"/> when an earlier snapshot was persisted while a later
/// logical edit had already advanced the document. A rename or save-as advances the instance version
/// for the identity change without changing the persisted content baseline, so
/// <see cref="PersistedVersion"/> can also trail <see cref="Version"/> on a document that is not
/// dirty; <see cref="IsDirty"/> is the authority for whether a document has unsaved changes.
/// <see cref="IsDirty"/> is computed by comparing
/// the current content and format with the persisted baseline, not from the versions, because an
/// edit can restore the baseline content at a newer version. The comparison reads the full content
/// only on the first snapshot after a content or format change; later snapshots reuse the cached
/// result until one of those fields changes again.
