	/// LF, CRLF, and lone CR line terminators are recognized. Trailing whitespace on retained lines is
	/// removed; blank lines at the start and end of the result are dropped, while the indentation of
	/// the retained lines is preserved exactly. A fence line is a run of at least three backticks
	/// followed by an optional info string that contains no further backticks. An opening fence line
	/// is removed, and only a fence of at least the same run length without an info string closes it,
	/// so a shorter or annotated fence-like line inside a fence stays part of the code content.
