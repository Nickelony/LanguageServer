/// <para>
/// A consumer queries the source during its read pass (for example while a margin draws its
/// markers), so the returned one-based line numbers must refer to the document currently shown
/// and be sorted ascending; the consumer walks them forward once per pass and ignores numbers
/// outside the document.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The source is queried inside the consumer's read pass, so <see cref="GetMarkedLineNumbers"/> must
/// not throw: an exception from the source surfaces inside the consumer's drawing pipeline and can
/// abort a whole pass. A source that cannot produce lines must return an empty list instead of
/// <see langword="null"/>. The read can run on every pass, so an implementation must cache its
/// result and recompute it only when its inputs actually change.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A source that also raises <see cref="IChangeNotificationSource.Changed"/> is followed by a consumer
/// that subscribes to it, which refreshes itself when the notification arrives, so no manual
/// invalidation call is required. A source without notifications requires the host to invalidate the
/// consumer after its marked lines change.
