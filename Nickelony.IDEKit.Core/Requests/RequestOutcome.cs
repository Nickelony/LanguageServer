/// <para>
/// Every admitted request that reaches its classification point (including cancellation and
/// supersession) reports exactly one member. A run whose compute delegate fails with any other
/// exception propagates the exception instead of reporting an outcome. The two comparable members
/// are <see cref="Superseded"/> (a newer request or an invalidation replaced it before
/// its result could be published) and <see cref="RejectedByCurrentState"/> (it is still the latest
/// request, but the caller's current-state predicate rejected the result).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Completed"/> is the first member, so <c>default(RequestOutcome)</c> reads as a
/// completed request. Treat an outcome as meaningful only when it was returned by a request run.

	/// <remarks>
	/// This covers a token that was already canceled when the run was admitted, a delegate that threw
	/// <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/>, and a delegate that returned after cancellation was
	/// requested. Cancellation is observed at the run's checkpoints (before the compute delegate runs,
	/// after it returns or throws, and before publication), so a cancellation that arrives while the
	/// publication callbacks run does not preempt publication and the run still reports
	/// <see cref="Completed"/>. The delegate is not still running when this outcome is observed.
	/// </remarks>
	Canceled = 1,

	/// <summary>
	/// The request was replaced by a newer request or an owner invalidation before its result could
	/// be published; its compute delegate may have been canceled first or may never have started.

	/// but its result was rejected by the current-state predicate.

	/// The request's compute delegate completed and the request is still the latest, but the host's

	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// A host typically observes this when its state moved on while the work was in flight (for
	/// example a version or generation the predicate compares). Compare with
	/// <see cref="Superseded"/>, which means a newer request or an owner invalidation
	/// replaced this one.
