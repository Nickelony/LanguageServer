/// <see cref="TargetRange"/> and <see cref="SelectionRange"/> use zero-based line and character
/// positions: lines count line breaks, and characters count UTF-16 code units within the line (a
/// tab counts as one character; it is not expanded to a tab stop). This is the one position model
/// in the package that is not an offset, because a definition can name a document the provider has
/// not materialized; hosts convert the positions to their own coordinate model when applying the
/// location.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="DocumentId"/> is an opaque provider-defined document identifier (for example a path,
/// a URI, or a logical key). A <see langword="null"/> or blank value means the definition is
/// located in the requested document; a non-empty value names another document whose opening is
/// owned by the host. A blank value is normalized to <see langword="null"/> and other values are
/// trimmed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="TargetRange"/> covers the whole definition (for example a function declaration).
/// <see cref="SelectionRange"/>, when present, identifies the definition's name and is expected to
/// be contained in the target range; hosts navigate to its start, or to the start of
/// <see cref="TargetRange"/> when it is <see langword="null"/>. Range values are stored as supplied
/// and their containment is not validated, because providers may supply partial range data.
