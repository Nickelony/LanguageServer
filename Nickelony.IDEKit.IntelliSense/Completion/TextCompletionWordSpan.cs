/// The word is normalized (an empty value behaves like an absent one); the range is used as
/// supplied and is not validated or clamped against a document. The <see cref="Word"/> is used to
/// filter completion items and the <see cref="Range"/> defines the document span replaced when a
/// completion is committed. Languages with word or replacement-range rules that differ from the
/// kernel default supply their own <see cref="TextCompletionWordSpan"/> through a
/// <see cref="TextCompletionWordLocator"/> or as the per-call <c>wordInfo</c> argument.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Word"/> reports an empty string for a <see langword="null"/> or empty assigned value,
/// so <c>default(TextCompletionWordSpan)</c> behaves like an explicitly empty word and is safe to
/// pass to filtering code. Its range is <c>(0, 0)</c>, so when the kernel receives the default as an
/// explicit <c>wordInfo</c> it collapses the replacement range at the document start and never
/// invokes the configured locator. Equality compares the normalized word and the range.
