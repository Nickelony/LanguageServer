	/// <remarks>
	/// One action's edit is independent of the other actions, so an edit that cannot be represented
	/// (an unsupported resource operation or an unresolvable target URI) drops that action only
	/// instead of failing the whole response. Entries without a usable title or edit are skipped.
	/// The shared action model carries no disabled state or per-action diagnostics, so a disabled
	/// action is surfaced as enabled without its explanation.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <param name="response">The code-action response payload, or <see langword="null"/> when unavailable.</param>
	/// <param name="logger">The logger instance, or <see langword="null"/> for no logging.</param>
	/// <returns>The parsed actions in response order, or an empty list when no usable action is present.</returns>
