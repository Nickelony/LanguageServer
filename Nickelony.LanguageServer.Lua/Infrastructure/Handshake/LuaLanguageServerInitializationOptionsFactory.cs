	/// <remarks>
	/// LuaLS reads these flags from the initialization options it receives. <c>useSemanticByRange</c>
	/// is fixed to <see langword="false"/> so the server registers full semantic-token requests (the
	/// client implements full requests only). <c>trustByClient</c> is fixed to
	/// <see langword="false"/> so LuaLS keeps its own plugin-trust checks instead of taking a trust
	/// assertion from a library that cannot present or answer a trust prompt.
	/// <c>changeConfiguration</c> and <c>viewDocument</c> are fixed to <see langword="false"/>
	/// because the client cannot serve the flows they gate: LuaLS routes configuration modification
	/// through a <c>$/command</c> notification and document reveals through
	/// <c>window/showDocument</c>, and neither has a handler. Advertising the flags would let LuaLS
	/// assume the flows were handled; with them disabled, LuaLS falls back to its own configuration
	/// handling (writing the workspace configuration file or reporting manual instructions).
	/// </remarks>
	/// <returns>An anonymous initialization-options object serialized into the initialize request.</returns>
